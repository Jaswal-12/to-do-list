    Build a ToDo List App is the second part of our Get Started guide that walks you through the steps of creating a ToDo List app on platformOS from setting up your development environment to deploying and testing your finished app. It explains basic concepts, main building blocks, and the logic behind platformOS, while also giving you some recommendations on workflow.

PreviewPreview
You can preview the completed application you will be building based on this tutorial. Open this page and get yourself familiar with it â€” It will make it easier to imagine everything that will be described below.

PrerequisitesPrerequisites
This tutorial assumes you have completed the Hello, World! tutorial.

The ToDo App will use a couple of basic building blocks available in platformOS:

Records with simple one-to-many relation
GraphQL Queries with basic filtering and sorting
GraphQL Mutations to update your database
Liquid filters
Liquid tags
Pages accepting GET, POST requests
Query parameters parsing
Static assets
Knowing most of the concepts will help you quickly understand what's going on. Knowledge of general web development concepts will also be helpful.

Frontend technology stackFrontend technology stack
For ease and speed of development a couple of tools have been used in this project.

Skeleton - Minimalistic CSS boilerplate
TailwindCSS - A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs
Alpine.js - A minimal framework for composing JavaScript behavior in your markup
If you find HTML code snippets that contain some data attributes or enigmatic CSS classes, those are TailwindCSS and Alpine.js in action. The functionality will work just fine without them, but we wanted to show a more user friendly experience without using heavy JavaScript frameworks.

Application functionalityApplication functionality
It is a good practice to write down exactly what you want to build before you start writing your first line of code. This will help you in multiple ways, but most importantly, it will allow you to follow a plan when implementing, which translates to saving a lot of time and avoiding distractions.

Your ToDo App will allow users to:

Step 1: Create new list
Step 2: View all lists
Step 3: Display list
Step 4: Rename list
Step 5: Delete empty list
Step 6: Create task
Step 7: Mark task as complete
Step 8: Edit a task's content
Step 9: Delete a task
And this is the order in which you will be implementing the application. Additionally, you will create GraphQL operations first, then pages that will trigger them.

File structureFile structure
The flexibility of platformOS allows you to merge a lot of these files, but for educational purposes we kept them all separate and categorized in resource-named directories (list, item).

This is what the file structure looks like for this particular application:
