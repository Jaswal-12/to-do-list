    Todoos > About Us
Why Todoos – We can help you with everything on your to-do list.
Do you feel like you will never get to the bottom of your to-do list? When you’re home, to remind yourself of all the things you need to get, and places you have to go to get them, you like to use the door to the fridge, or good, old-fashioned stickies. And even if you’re really on top of things, you use your phone to manage your ever-expanding to-do list.

But what about when you’re at the office? You’ve got a ton of items on your to-do list and it seems like someone’s always knocking on your door for something. Wouldn’t it be great if you could find exactly the things you were looking for – all in a single place, easily managed, organized, and hand-picked by other professionals so you know that every product is the best of the best?

At Todoos.com our goal is to have every specification of any item on your business shopping list professionally vetted, priced compared, and organized for a more ‘human’ experience.

That’s why we’ve built our system to mirror the simplicity of Amazon-like web stores but to have the ability to grow beyond a place to simply shop. Todoos.com is more importantly about providing our clients with the human touch – a real person to connect with and guide you through your shopping experience. It’s almost like having the smartest personal assistant working for you 24/7… for free.

We know to-do lists! – The Todoos superpower.
For over 40 years we have been helping professionals find exactly the right items on their to-do lists. That’s right, four decades. We’ve become the perfect team of product sourcing professionals. We know how to assist anyone with a long list and a short timeframe.

Over the years, we’ve seen the frustration and the disappointment that comes from finding, ordering and getting a product that was not ‘exactly’ what was delivered. We know about the headaches that come along with sifting through millions of products and hundreds of web stores, brochures and sales sheets. Any yes, we know all about that ‘special’ moment when you finally track down what seems to be the best product. You know the one? It fits your specs and your budget. But… it shows up 5 days late, and looks nothing like the photos online.

The Todoos Delivery Guarantee – No surprises for small orders!
Don’t you just want to explode when you finally find exactly what you’re looking for, and the price to ship it to your office is almost the same price as your order? Try explaining that to your boss! At Todoos.com our shipping goal is to make sure everyone has access to the best delivery price no matter the quantity of your order. We will also be providing clients with our ‘QuickToo’ service option – a personalized service for volume purchases. QuickToo will provide every client with the ability to order 2 to 3 portable posts AND still get special pricing for 100!

Coming Soon! We’re building Todoos for customers just like you.
Even though in the short term, we will be focusing on showcasing products and services that primarily focus on portable directional devices for pedestrians and vehicles, our goal is to expand our content and product list every week. Initially, we will be focusing on servicing companies that are managing public venues, special events, races, casinos, and college and university athletic departments. Within each of these organizations, we intend to pay particular attention to the needs of each professional within the parking, operations, maintenance, food and beverage and security departments.

Beyond the thousands of new products and services we will continuously add to the Todoos experience, we are also planning to include additional markets, industries and departments each 3-4 months over the next year.

Making the Cut – The coveted Todoos supplier list
If you’re like most of us at Todoos, you’ve been hood-winked (only once hopefully) by a vendor selling a ‘five-star’ product on a big shopping site. The worst part about it is the fact that you checked the reviews (bogus), sifted through the photos (fakes), and you trusted the product specifications (ha!). This is why our promise is to offer only the best of the best.

We will never represent or endorse any cheap look-alike products shipped in from any questionable off-shore location. From product details, delivery, product and service guarantees and customer service, each Todoos supplier is 100% vetted by a Todoos ProductPro Agent. Each one is willing to do whatever it takes to ensure you never have to worry about a product or delivery ‘whoops’.

The Todoos Brand Promise Everything will perform exactly as stated!
After wasting countless dollars and hours on cheap knock-offs, we are all looking for products that can adhere to one simple claim: “Will perform exactly as stated”. No exceptions, special conditions, or fine print. At Todoos each product will come with two levels of verification. One, we are holding every supplier responsible. They must stand 100% behind any of their products and services that we select to list in our store. And two, any product, vendor or service that carries the Todoos name, will be personally vetted and examined by a Todoos ProductPro.

The Todoos Name: There will always be something extra to add to the list.
“Oh, I forgot about that!…put it on the list!”

Whether it’s another bullet point, check mark or checked off bullet point, our name grew out of the idea that everyone’s list seems to always be growing. Our name and brand are simple and to the point. They both focus on you and your needs – and our willingness to help. Our name is our way of celebrating the fact that as Americans, we love to be busy, ahead of the pack, and better than our competitors. At Todoos.com we like to think of our ‘extra O” as a symbol of the ‘Oh…!” we can add to your business.
