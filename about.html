in most cases, you just edit the task as described below, summarizing the change and its reason in the edit summary as necessary
if more discussion space is needed, enter a new heading at the bottom of the talk page of the article (not in the to-do page) to start a new discussion

at the top of the edit box, enter {{to do}}
save your edit : the talk page is now shown with an empty to-do list

click the "edit" link at the top of the to-do list
you can now either:
use the default template text by using "Task" fields as explained in Template:Tasks
remove the default template text and simply enter "*" followed by the description of the task. Please begin with a verb such as "explain", "discuss", "justify" to clearly describe the task.
enter an edit summary as needed, select "watch", and save your changes.
